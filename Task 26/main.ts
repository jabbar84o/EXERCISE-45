//  Allien color#3 Choose a color for an alien as you did in Exercise 25, and write an if-else chain. 
// • If the alien’s color is green, print a statement that the player just earned 5 points for shooting the 
// alien. 
// • If the alien’s color isn’t green, print a statement that the player just earned 10 points. 
// • Write one version of this program that runs the if block and another that runs the else block. 


// let allien_color = "green"
// if (allien_color == "green"){
// console.log("player just earned 5 points for shoting the allien")
// } else{
//     console.log("player just earned just 10 points")
// }
