// Adding Comments:  
// Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. If you don’t 
// have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name 
// and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence describing what the 
// program does.
